### Introduction
Netflix Clone

This is my attempt at creating a mid-level web application that highly depends on making a lot of network requests to an API that works with images (high load) and finding ways to mitigate this requests and minimise load on the server.

The application is built with React and uses react-query to manage the data fetching. Categories Data is cached locally (using react-query) and is updated after every 15mins while banner data is updated consistently on component mount and also after every 10s. This results in a much better user experience.

Redux is also used to manage the state of the application.
